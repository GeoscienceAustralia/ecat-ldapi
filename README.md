# eCat Linked Data API
This Python Flask application is a web API that delivers very basic HTML pages with HTML meta tags based on 
[Dublin Core elements](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) extracted from ISO19115-3 metadata records in XML via a 
[Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalog_Service_for_the_Web) service. 

It is implemented by [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au) to allow a web spiders, particularly the Google Search 
Appliance (GSA) to be able to index these properties for good site searching. The static index for the items in the CSW 
catalogue is generated by a separate Python application, the StaticReg tool: 
<https://bitbucket.org/geoscienceaustralia/ecat-staticreg>.
 
The static index that triggers this application is online at:

* Datasets: <http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset-staticreg/>  

The code only consists of a single Python file containing simple functions and a \__main\__ method used to perform the 
CSW requests, ID extraction and static file generation. The static files are layed out using Jinja2 templates within
the _templates_ directory.


## Installing
To install this app, you need to clone the repo to a directory. The app runs on Python 3 (3.6 tested) and all Python 
dependencies are in requirements.txt. You will also need Apache2 or another WSGI-capable web server to invoke this API.


## Running
Ensure Apache or similar can spawn a WSGI process for some path to access this API. To do this you will need to edit an 
Apache or similar config along the lines of the example-apache.conf file. You will need to ensure that the metatag.wsgi 
 file is references in that config file, as it is in the example.
 
For the GA eCat instance, this application's individual dataset endpoint is redirected to by the PID Service at 
<http://pid.geoscience.gov.au> which uses the pattern 
*http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/(dataset|service)/([0-9]{2,7})?_view=metatag* pointing to  
*http://13.54.73.187/metataggen/dataset/$2*.
